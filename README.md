# BTLTECH Music Website

Premium static multi-page music hub for BTLTECH Music, built for Cloudflare Pages.
Home of two artists (BTLTECH and Choko King) and the Lyrid lyric-video app.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — home hub (hero, Lyrid promo, latest release, both artists)
- `btltech.html` — BTLTECH artist page (bio, releases, videos, contact)
- `choko-king.html` — Choko King artist page (separate artist, own links/releases)
- `lyrid.html` — Lyrid app landing page (features, how-it-works, screenshots, download)
- `press-kit.html` — EPK / press kit
- `contact.html` — contact page
- `privacy-policy.html`, `terms-of-service.html` — legal pages
- `styles.css` — full site styling and responsive layout (shared across all pages)
- `script.js` — links, release routing, embeds, mailing-list behavior, and menu logic (shared)
- `assets/` — artwork, logos, icons, OG image, artist portraits, Lyrid screens, press assets
- `site.webmanifest` — basic install metadata
- `sw.js` — service worker caching all pages

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to Cloudflare.
3. Open `Workers & Pages`.
4. Create a new `Pages` project.
5. Connect the GitHub repository.
6. Use no build command for this plain static site.
7. Set the output directory to the project root, usually `.`.
8. Deploy.
9. Connect the custom domain `btltechmusic.com`.
10. Test the live site on mobile and desktop.

## Before Public Launch

- Add remaining social and smart links.
- Add per-release links where available.
- Replace placeholder visuals with approved assets.
- Add real pre-save and teaser URLs.
- Update the EPK with final stats, placements, and media references.
- Confirm the mailing list integration and replace the mailto fallback if needed.
- Review `privacy-policy.html` and `terms-of-service.html` for final legal copy.
- Test the site on an actual phone.

## Notes

- The site now includes basic offline support via `sw.js` and service worker registration in `script.js`.
- Privacy and terms pages were added for launch readiness.

- Empty optional social buttons are hidden until links are added.
- Missing non-social actions show a `Coming Soon` state.
- CSS and JS are cache-busted from `index.html` with version query strings.
